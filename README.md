## Installation in your project

```

### Usage in your project

If you've enabled `eslint` locally within your project, just set your `.eslintrc.[json|js]` config to extend the rules from this repo:

#### Extend Globally
```json
{
    "extends": "@team23/eslint-config-team23-standard"
}
```

#### Extend overrides
```json
{
    "overrides": [
        {
            "files": [
                "*.ts",
                "*.tsx",
                "*.js",
                "*.jsx"
            ],
            "extends": [
                "@team23/eslint-config-team23-standard"
            ],
            rules: {}
        }
    ]
}
```

### Extending the .eslintrc.json

Simply add a `"rules"` key to your config, then add your overrides and additions there.

{
    "extends": "@team23/eslint-config-team23-standard",
    "rules": {
        "no-magic-numbers": "off"
    }
}
```
